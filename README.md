# 2host

2host (pronounced “Toast”) is a DIY USBMIDI host-to-host adapter.

2host uses 2 [TeensyLC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html)’s or 2 [Adafruit QtPy's](https://www.adafruit.com/qtpy) to create a really short hardware MIDI bridge between two USBMIDI Host devices.

Here are a few examples of USBMIDI hosts which could be connected together:

hardware    
- norns 
- organelle 
- ansible (needs testing) 
- ipad (with Camera Connection kit) 
- raspberry pi (pisound, etc.) 

software on any computer  
- ableton 
- orca  
- VCV Rack 
- etc.
